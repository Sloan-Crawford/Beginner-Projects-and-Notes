-flex items are direct children of flex containers
-container created with 'display: flex'
-flex containers and items have different properties that can be adjusted

Axes:

helps with responsiveness. If a flex-item can't fit, it wraps to the next line


Responsive Widths:

flex-basis: 
-sets smallest individual width for flex-item

flex-grow: 
-default is 0. think of it as a grow rate. 1 is rate of 1, 2 is faster rate, etc.
-covers the entire width of the flex-container

-opposite of flex-grow.
-don't use it much at all.

COMBINE GROW, SHRINK & BASIS:
flex: (grow, shrink, basis)
flex: 1, 0, 100px
(grows at a rate of 1, shrink usually keep at 0, basis using desired units or often 0)
-shorthand is flex: 1 (don't have to set shrink or basis if they are 0, which is often)
