# Beginner Projects
## HTML, CSS and Javascript projects

**Simply Recipes** is my first project using html, CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript. I used templates and followed a guide created by John Smilgma from CodingAddict.

The **CSS Tutorial** includes my work and notes in each styles.css subfile for all CSS basics.

The **Javascript Tutorial** includes my notes in the tutorial-output js file on fundamentals, methods, the DOM tree, objects, functions, modules, asynch and ajax.

The **Portfolio Project** is my first simple guided portfolio website. Missing accurate info since it was just to practice the process.

The **Basic Javascript Projects** include notes and reflections in each app.js file, which I expound upon in my youtube vlog.
