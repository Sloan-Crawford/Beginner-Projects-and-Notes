HTML, CSS and Javascript projects

Simply Recipes is my first project using html, CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript. I used templates and followed a guide created by John Smilgma from CodingAddict.

The Portfolio Project is my first simple guided portfolio website. Missing accurate info since it was just to practice the process.

The Basic Javascript projects include notes and reflections in each app.js file, which is expound upon in my youtube vlog.

Many more projects to come!
